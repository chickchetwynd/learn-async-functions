## Introduction

Async functions in JavaScript allow you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous and readable manner. They are built on top of promises and provide a simpler syntax for handling asynchronous operations.

## Async/Await

Async/await is a syntax sugar on top of promises that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code. It makes it easier to handle asynchronous operations and avoids the "callback hell" problem.

## Promises

Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that may be available now, in the future, or never. Promises provide a clean and consistent way to work with asynchronous code.

## Error Handling

Error handling is an important aspect of writing async functions. JavaScript provides various mechanisms to handle errors in async code, such as try/catch blocks and promise rejections.

## Parallel Execution

Async functions can be used to execute multiple asynchronous operations in parallel. This can greatly improve the performance of your code by leveraging the power of concurrency.
